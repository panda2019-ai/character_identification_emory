# 角色识别

角色识别是实体关系识别的一个子任务。它的目标是在多人对话中找到mention的全局的真实角色。
这些mention可以是人名实体（贾志国、和平等），代词（她、他等），或物主代词（他的）等。
下边的例子为情景喜剧《我爱我家》中的一段对话，在这里我们标出了所有mentions。

## Dataset

All personal mentions are annotated with their global entities.
For the above example, the first mention "I" is annotated with its global entity, *Ross Geller*, and the second mention "mom" is annotated with, *Judy Geller*, and so on.
The mention detection is first performed automatically then corrected manually.
The entity annotation is mostly crowdsourced although lots of them are fixed manually by experts.

## Statistics

For each season, episodes 1 ~ 19 are used for training (TRN), 20 ~ 21 for development (DEV), and 22 ~ rest for evaluation (TST).

| Dataset | Episodes | Scenes | Utterances |  Tokens | Speakers | Mentions | Entities |
|:-------:|---------:|-------:|-----------:|--------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| TRN   | 76 | 987   | 18,789 | 262,650 | 265 | 36,385 | 628 |
| DEV   | 8  | 122   | 2142   | 28523   | 48  | 3932   | 102 |
| TST   | 13 | 192   | 3,597  | 50,232  | 91  | 7,050  | 165 |
| Total | 97 | 1,301 | 24,528 | 341,405 | 331 | 47,367 | 781 |

## Annotation

Each utterance is split into sentences and personal mentions in every sentence are annotated with their entities.
For the example below, the utterance consists of one sentence including four mentions.
The first three mentions, *I*, **mom* and *dad*, are singular that refer to *Ross Geller*, *Judy Geller* and *Jack Geller*, respectively.
The last mention, *they*, is plural that refers to both *Judy Geller* and *Jack Geller*.

```json
{
  "utterance_id": "s01_e01_c01_u039",
  "speakers": ["Ross Geller"],
  "transcript": "I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.",
  "tokens": [
    ["I", "told", "mom", "and", "dad", "last", "night", ",", "they", "seemed", "to", "take", "it", "pretty", "well", "."]
  ],
  "character_entities": [
    [[0, 1, "Ross Geller"], [2, 3, "Judy Geller"], [4, 5, "Jack Geller"], [8, 9, "Jack Geller", "Judy Geller"]]
  ]
}
```

Each mention is annotated by the following scheme:

```
[begin_index, end_index, entity(, entity)*]
```

* `begin_index: int` - the beginning token index of the mention (inclusive).
* `end_index: int` - the ending token index of the mention (exclusive).
* `entity: str` - the label of the entity.
